Adding ability to customize the "unregister entity" menu item in the entity context menu on the entity page with options 'visible','hidden','disabled'.With this three new options, one can hide the "unregister entity" menu item from the list, disable or keep it enabled.

The boolean input for "unregister entity" will be deprecated later in favour of the above three options.
